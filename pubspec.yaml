  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - images/w.png
   - images/ws.png
   - images/try33.jpg
   - images/detail.jpeg
   - images/discover.jpeg
   - images/wsn.png
   - images/hause.jpeg

  # or to include all assets from a directory do this:
  # assets:
  #   - assets/images/
  
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  #  assets:
  #  - assets/images/
  
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
